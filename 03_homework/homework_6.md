**Write**: Reflect on your previous work and how you would adjust to include ethics and inequity components. Total length should be a few paragraphs, no more than one page.

Data about service participants is something that organizations should take seriously. There are situations where the business structure makes it possible for data to be accidentally disclosed without the service participant's express agreement. At the non-profit organization where I work, researchers have occasionally approached managers to request community involvement in their studies. 

There have been instances where managers have consented to studies that are not optimal for the community. Additionally, information is occasionally gathered informally without being entered into service databases. Before engaging with researchers now, every request is examined, vetted, and provided to the executive team by the quality assurance department. Daily operations record client involvement in services in the databases, and case managers secure consent at the moment of client engagement, immediately before the service begins. By restricting the amount of data that researchers can access, the organization is safeguarding this community from having their data improperly shared.
